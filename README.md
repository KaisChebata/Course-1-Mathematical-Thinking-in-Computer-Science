# Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science Course

 This course will cover the most important tools used in discrete mathematics:
 - induction;
 - recursion; 
 - logic; 
 - invariants; 
 - optimality. 
 
 **These tools will used to answer typical programming questions** like:
 - How can we be certain a solution exists?
 - Am I sure my program computes the optimal answer? 
 - Do each of these objects meet the given requirements?
